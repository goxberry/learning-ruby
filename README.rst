Purpose
#######

The purpose of this repository is for my own practice with Ruby. There
are some cool Ruby projects I would like to contribute (or continue
contributing) to, so I felt it was time to learn the language more
systematically.

I welcome suggestions. I will probably not accept Pull Requests; the
purpose of this repository is for me to learn Ruby, so I need to do the
coding myself.
